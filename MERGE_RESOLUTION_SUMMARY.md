**Reason:** Our version contains complete session progress and metrics

### 2. logs/sims.log

**Details:**
- Kept: `path("api/analytics/", include("sims.analytics.urls"))`
- Added from main: bulk, notifications, reports routes
- Result: All 6 API routes present

### 4. sims/cases/models.py
**Conflict Type:** Field validation check differences  
**Resolution:** Used main's safer approach with field IDs  
**Details:**
- Changed from: `hasattr(self, "pg") and self.pg_id`

## Migration Conflicts

### Issue
Both branches created migrations to remove the same constraint:
- Branch A: `0003_remove_clinicalcase_case_date_not_future.py`
- Branch B: `0003_remove_date_constraint.py`
- Same for logbook: two versions of 0006 migration

### Resolution
1. Deleted duplicate migrations from main branch
2. Kept our versions: 
   - `sims/cases/migrations/0003_remove_date_constraint.py`
   - `sims/logbook/migrations/0006_remove_date_constraint.py`
3. Removed auto-generated merge migrations (0004, 0007)
4. All migrations applied successfully

## Strategy Used

### For Test Files
- **Strategy:** Keep our version (--ours)
- **Reason:** We've been systematically fixing tests
- **Files:** cases/tests.py, logbook/tests.py, rotations/tests.py

### For Factory Files
- **Strategy:** Keep our version (--ours)
- **Reason:** We've improved factory setup with proper fields
- **Files:** case_factories.py, logbook_factories.py

### For View Files
- **Strategy:** Keep our version (--ours)
- **Reason:** Our version has proper formatting and imports
- **Files:** logbook/views.py

### For Model Files
- **Strategy:** Manual merge, prefer safer code
- **Reason:** Need to ensure data safety
- **Files:** cases/models.py, logbook/models.py, rotations/models.py

### For URL Configuration
- **Strategy:** Manual merge, keep all routes
- **Reason:** Need all API endpoints
- **Files:** sims_project/urls.py

### For Documentation
- **Strategy:** Keep our version
- **Reason:** More comprehensive
- **Files:** SESSION_SUMMARY.md

### For Transient Files
- **Strategy:** Remove from tracking
- **Reason:** Should not be version controlled
- **Files:** logs/sims.log

## Recommendations

### For Future Merges
1. Always check for duplicate migrations
2. Use `--ours` strategy for test files when actively fixing them
3. Manually merge model files to ensure safety
4. Keep all API routes when merging URL configuration
5. Remove transient files (logs) from tracking

### For Code Review
1. Verify all API routes are present in urls.py
2. Check that field validation uses ID checks for safety
3. Ensure test files have force_login() not login()
4. Verify migrations are linear and non-duplicate
5. Confirm .gitignore includes logs directory
