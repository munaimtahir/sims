   - Enhanced Django admin with custom dashboard analytics
   - Preserved all original functionality

2. 🔄 IMPLEMENTED SEAMLESS REDIRECTS
   - Admin users now auto-redirect to /admin/ on login
   - Old /users/admin-dashboard/ URL redirects to /admin/
   - Backward compatibility maintained

3. 📊 ENHANCED DJANGO ADMIN WITH ANALYTICS
   - Real-time user statistics
   - Interactive Chart.js specialty distribution
   - System status monitoring
   - Recent users display
   - Enhanced quick actions

4. 🛠️ TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS
   - API endpoint for dynamic data: /users/api/admin/stats/
   - Modern responsive design
   - Error handling and loading states
   - Performance optimizations

📁 Files Modified:
-----------------
✅ templates/admin/index.html      - Enhanced with dashboard features
✅ sims/users/models.py            - Updated admin redirects
✅ sims/users/views.py             - Updated all admin redirects
✅ sims/users/urls.py              - API endpoint configuration

🚀 Result:
----------
• Single admin interface at /admin/ with ALL functionality
• No broken links or missing features
• Better user experience and maintainability
• Reduced code duplication

🎯 URLs After Consolidation:
---------------------------
• Main Admin: http://localhost:8000/admin/
• Old URL:    http://localhost:8000/users/admin-dashboard/ → redirects to /admin/
• API Data:   http://localhost:8000/users/api/admin/stats/

📝 Testing Instructions:
------------------------
1. Start server: python manage.py runserver
2. Visit: http://localhost:8000/admin/
3. Login as admin user
4. Verify all analytics, charts, and quick actions work
5. Test old URL redirects properly

✨ CONSOLIDATION COMPLETE! ✨

The custom admin dashboard at /users/admin-dashboard/ is now redundant 
and all its functionality is available in the enhanced Django admin at /admin/.

Admin users will automatically be redirected to /admin/ for a unified
administrative experience.
