# Migration Notes - SIMS v1.0.0

## Performance Index Migration (v1.0.0)

**Migration:** `analytics.0001_add_performance_indexes`  
**Date:** 2025-10-23  
**Type:** Performance optimization

### Purpose
Add database indexes to improve query performance for high-traffic endpoints in analytics, search, and reporting features.

### Indexes Added

#### Logbook Indexes
- `idx_logbook_pg_date` - Composite index on (pg_id, date) for PG-specific queries
- `idx_logbook_supervisor_date` - Composite index on (supervisor_id, date) for supervisor queries
- `idx_logbook_status_date` - Composite index on (status, date) for status-based filtering

#### Cases Indexes
- `idx_case_pg_date` - Composite index on (pg_id, date_encountered) for case queries
- `idx_case_category` - Composite index on (category_id, date_encountered) for category filtering

#### Certificates Indexes
- `idx_cert_pg_status` - Composite index on (pg_id, status) for certificate status queries
- `idx_cert_issue_date` - Index on issue_date for date-range queries

#### Rotations Indexes
- `idx_rotation_pg_dates` - Composite index on (pg_id, start_date, end_date) for rotation queries
- `idx_rotation_supervisor` - Composite index on (supervisor_id, status) for supervisor queries

### Expected Performance Impact
- 40-60% reduction in query time for analytics endpoints
- 30-50% improvement in search response time
- Better scalability for large datasets (>10,000 records per table)

### Rollback
If needed, the migration can be reversed:
```bash
python manage.py migrate analytics zero
```

This will drop all the custom indexes but preserve all data.

### Testing
Run after migration to verify indexes:
```sql
-- PostgreSQL
SELECT indexname, tablename FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE indexname LIKE 'idx_%' 
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;

-- SQLite
SELECT name, tbl_name FROM sqlite_master 
WHERE type='index' AND name LIKE 'idx_%'
ORDER BY tbl_name, name;
```

## Historical Migrations

All previous migrations have been successfully applied. See `MIGRATION_LOG.md` for complete history.

## Future Migration Notes

### Planned for v1.1.0
- Add async report generation tables
- Add saved search preferences
- Add notification preferences expansion
- Consider partitioning for large audit logs

### Best Practices
1. Always backup database before running migrations
2. Test migrations on staging environment first
3. Run migrations during low-traffic periods
4. Monitor query performance after index additions
5. Use `--fake` flag only when absolutely necessary

## Migration Checklist

Before running migrations in production:
- [ ] Database backup completed
- [ ] Staging environment tested
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Performance baseline captured
- [ ] Downtime window scheduled (if needed)

After migration:
- [ ] Verify all migrations applied successfully
- [ ] Check database integrity
- [ ] Validate index creation
- [ ] Run smoke tests
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Document any issues encountered
