# SIMS Documentation Index

This directory consolidates every project guide, operational report, and deployment reference that previously lived across the repository root. No information has been removed during the reorganization—each original document now resides here with its content intact.

## How to Navigate

- Start with **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** for a one-page status briefing.
- Use **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** together with **PROJECT_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md** and **COMPLETE_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md** for the complete directory layout history. These files were moved from the repository root and retain their original details.
- Consult the categorized lists below to jump directly to the information you need.

## Project & Architecture Guides

- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` – Current directory layout with context for each folder.
- `PROJECT_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md` – Step-by-step organization procedure (migrated from the repository root).
- `COMPLETE_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md` – Expanded rationale for the standardized structure (migrated from the repository root).
- `PROJECT_ORGANIZATION_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` – Verification of the reorganization work.
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` – Executive summary of the SIMS platform.
- `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md` & `CONTRIBUTING.md` – Engineering processes and contribution workflow.

## Deployment & Infrastructure

- `NGINX_DEPLOYMENT_172.236.152.35.md`, `NGINX_SERVER_172.236.152.35_COMPLETE.md` – Reverse proxy setup records.

## Testing Artifacts

- Manual logbook routing test: `LOGBOOK_ROUTING_TEST.md`.

- `LOGBOOK_FORM_ENHANCEMENT_REPORT.md` & `LOGBOOK_ROUTING_TEST.md` – Logbook-specific adjustments.

## Verification Checklist

- ✅ `COMPLETE_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md`, `PROJECT_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md`, and `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` are present with their full original content.
- ✅ All deployment, bug-fix, and feature status documents from the repository root have been preserved in this directory.
- ✅ New directory structure is documented in the root `README.md` (see the *Project Structure* section) and cross-referenced here.

If you notice a documentation gap or need a new summary, open an issue or submit a pull request referencing this index.
