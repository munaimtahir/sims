**Status:** ✅ FIXED & ENHANCED

## Role-Based Access Control

### Supervisors Can:
- ✅ View and manage their assigned PGs (`/users/pgs/`)
- ✅ View case statistics for their supervised cases (`/cases/statistics/`)
- ✅ View logbook entries from their assigned PGs (`/logbook/`)
- ✅ Create individual rotations for their PGs (`/rotations/create/`)
- ✅ Perform bulk rotation assignments for their PGs (`/rotations/bulk-assignment/`)
- ✅ View certificate dashboard for their PGs (`/certificates/dashboard/`)
- ✅ Review, assess, grade, and approve logbooks, cases, and certificates from their PGs
- ✅ Access only content related to their assigned postgraduates

### Supervisors Cannot:
- ❌ Submit new logbooks (only PGs can submit)
- ❌ Submit new clinical cases (only PGs can submit)
- ❌ Submit new certificates (only PGs can submit)
- ❌ Access content from PGs not assigned to them
- ❌ Perform system-wide administrative functions (admin-only)

### PGs Can:
- ✅ Submit logbooks, clinical cases, and certificates
- ✅ View their own submissions and progress
- ❌ Access other PGs' content
- ❌ Perform supervisor or administrative functions

## Key Files Modified

### 1. `sims/rotations/views.py`
- Updated `BulkRotationAssignmentView.test_func()` to allow supervisors
- Added `get_form_kwargs()` to pass user to form
- Enhanced `form_valid()` with supervisor-specific logic and additional permission checks

### 2. `sims/rotations/forms.py`
- Added `__init__()` method to `BulkRotationAssignmentForm`
- Implemented supervisor-specific field filtering and restrictions
- Updated `clean()` method to handle supervisor field assignment
- Added form validation for supervisor permissions

### 3. `sims/users/views.py`
- Added `@login_required` decorator to `pg_list_view()`
- Added proper permission check for supervisor and admin roles
- Enhanced error handling with `PermissionDenied`

### 4. `templates/rotations/bulk_assignment.html`
- **CREATED NEW TEMPLATE**
- Comprehensive form interface for bulk rotation assignment
- Role-based UI adjustments (supervisor vs admin)
- JavaScript enhancements for department filtering and PG selection
- Responsive design with proper error handling

## Security Enhancements

1. **Permission Checks:** All views now have proper role-based access control
2. **Data Isolation:** Supervisors can only access data for their assigned PGs
3. **Form Validation:** Prevents supervisors from assigning rotations to PGs not under their supervision
4. **Auto-Assignment:** Supervisors are automatically set as the supervisor for rotations they create

## Workflow Compliance

The system now properly enforces the intended workflow:
- **PGs:** Create and submit content (logbooks, cases, certificates)
- **Supervisors:** Review, assess, grade, and approve content from their assigned PGs
- **Admins:** Have full system access and can manage all users and content

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test bulk assignment with supervisor account
2. Verify supervisors can only see their assigned PGs
3. Confirm supervisors cannot access other supervisors' PG data
4. Validate that assessment and grading functions work properly
5. Test all permission boundaries and error handling

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All supervisor-facing pages are now properly configured with appropriate permissions and functionality. The bulk assignment feature has been enhanced to support supervisor usage while maintaining proper security boundaries.
