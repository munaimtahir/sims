## Common Issues Found

### 1. User Creation Validation Errors (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Affected Tests:** 74 tests across cases, logbook, certificates modules

**Root Cause:** User model requires specialty, year, and supervisor for PG users; specialty for supervisors

**Example Error:**
```python
django.core.exceptions.ValidationError: {'specialty': ['Specialty is required for PGs']}
```

**Fix Required:** Update all test setUp methods to include required fields

**Pattern for Fix:**
```python
# Bad (current):
self.pg = User.objects.create_user(username="pg", role="pg")

# Good (required):
self.pg = User.objects.create_user(
    username="pg",
    role="pg", 
    specialty="medicine",
    year="1",
    supervisor=self.supervisor
)
```

### 2. RelatedObjectDoesNotExist Errors

**Affected:** certificates/models.py, rotations/models.py

**Error:**
```python
CertificateReview.reviewer.RelatedObjectDoesNotExist: CertificateReview has no reviewer.
RotationEvaluation.evaluator.RelatedObjectDoesNotExist: RotationEvaluation has no evaluator.
```

**Cause:** Model clean() methods accessing ForeignKey before object is saved

**Fix Required:** Check for id before accessing related fields:
```python
# Bad:
if self.reviewer and self.certificate:
    
# Good:
if self.reviewer_id and self.certificate_id:
```

### 3. Form Validation Failures

**Affected Tests:** 4 tests in logbook and certificates

**Issues:**
- Form.is_valid() returning False unexpectedly
- Missing required fields in form test data
- Date validation issues

### 4. Redirect Status Code Mismatches

**Affected Tests:** 2 tests

**Issues:**
- Expected 302 (redirect), got 301 (permanent redirect)
- Expected 302 (redirect), got 403 (permission denied)
- Expected 302 (redirect), got 200 (success with form errors)
