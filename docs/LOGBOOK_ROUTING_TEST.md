## Logbook URL Routing Test Instructions

### The Button You Should Click

On the PG Dashboard (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/pg-dashboard/`), look for:

**Statistics Card with Logbook Entry Count:**
- This is a card that shows a number (like "5" or "10") 
- Below the number it says "Logbook Entries"
- It has a blue book icon (ðŸ“–) on the right side
- This entire card is clickable and should now go to `/logbook/` instead of `/logbook/pg/entries/`

### Do NOT Click These Other Buttons:
- "New Logbook Entry" button (creates a new entry)
- "New Entry" button in the no activity section (also creates a new entry)

### Testing Steps:
1. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/pg-dashboard/`
2. Find the "Logbook Entries" statistics card (blue border, book icon)
3. Click on that card
4. You should now go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/logbook/` instead of `/logbook/pg/entries/`

### If It Still Goes to the Old URL:
1. Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Or try in an incognito/private window

### Browser Cache Issue:
If the browser cached the old page, you might need to:
- Close and reopen the browser
- Use Ctrl+F5 to force refresh
- Try in a private/incognito window
