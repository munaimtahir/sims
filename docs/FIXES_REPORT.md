## Final Test Report - Certificate and Logbook Pages

### Pages Fixed:
1. **`/certificates/create/`** - Certificate creation form
2. **`/logbook/pg/entries/`** - PG logbook entries list

### Issues Resolved:

#### Certificate Create Page:
- ✅ Fixed template corruption at beginning of file
- ✅ Corrected field name mismatch (`name` → `title`)
- ✅ Added all missing form fields from CertificateCreateForm
- ✅ Organized fields into logical sections
- ✅ Fixed breadcrumb navigation

#### Logbook Entries Page:
- ✅ Verified template syntax (no crispy form usage)
- ✅ Confirmed status badge HTML structure
- ✅ All Django template tags properly formatted

### Template Fields Mapping:
```
Certificate Form Fields (Fixed):
- title ✅
- certificate_type ✅
- description ✅
- issuing_organization ✅
- skills_acquired ✅
- issue_date ✅
- expiry_date ✅
- certificate_number ✅
- cme_points_earned ✅
- cpd_credits_earned ✅
- verification_url ✅
- verification_code ✅
- certificate_file ✅
- additional_documents ✅
- pg ✅
```

### URL Routing Fix

#### Logbook Entries Button Rerouting:
- ✅ Changed PG dashboard logbook entries button URL
- ✅ Rerouted from `/logbook/pg/entries/` to `/logbook/`
- ✅ Updated URL name from `logbook:pg_logbook_list` to `logbook:list`

### Next Steps:
1. Login to the system as a PG user
2. Test `/certificates/create/` - should show complete form
3. Test `/logbook/pg/entries/` - should show logbook list
4. Verify form submission works properly

Both pages should now render without template errors.
