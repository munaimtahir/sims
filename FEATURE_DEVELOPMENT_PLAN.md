|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| 2FA implementation takes longer | High | Medium | Start immediately, allocate extra dev |
| Backup restore fails | Critical | Low | Test recovery procedures weekly |
| Monitoring setup delays | High | Medium | Use managed services (Datadog) |
| Security vulnerabilities found | Critical | Medium | Conduct security audit, pen testing |

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Buffer Time**: Add 20% buffer to all estimates

3. **Backup Plan**: Have rollback strategy for each feature
4. **Risk Review**: Weekly risk assessment meetings

### Phase 2 Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Notification system spam issues | Medium | Medium | Implement rate limiting, testing |
| Search performance degrades | High | Medium | Use Elasticsearch, caching |
| Bulk operations cause data issues | Critical | Low | Extensive testing, transaction rollback |
| Production stability issues | Critical | Medium | Continuous monitoring, rollback ready |

### Phase 3 Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Feature complexity increases | High | High | Agile methodology, regular reviews |
| Schedule slippage | Medium | High | Regular sprint planning, velocity tracking |
| Team members leave | High | Medium | Documentation, knowledge sharing |
| Scope creep | High | High | Strict change control, backlog management |

### Risk Response Plan

**Prevention** (Before issue occurs):
- Regular code reviews
- Automated testing
- Architecture reviews
- Performance testing

**Detection** (Identify early):
- Weekly metrics review
- Monitoring dashboards
- User feedback channels
- QA test results

**Response** (When issue occurs):
- Immediate escalation
- Root cause analysis
- Corrective action plan
- Communication to stakeholders

## Quality Assurance Strategy

### Testing Approach

#### Unit Testing (Developers)
- **Target**: 80%+ code coverage
- **Frequency**: Continuous (every commit)
- **Tools**: pytest, coverage.py
- **Definition**: Test individual functions/methods

#### Integration Testing (QA + Developers)
- **Target**: 100% of API endpoints
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Tools**: pytest, REST client
- **Definition**: Test component interactions

#### System Testing (QA)
- **Target**: All user workflows
- **Frequency**: Weekly
- **Tools**: Selenium, manual testing
- **Definition**: Test complete system behavior

#### User Acceptance Testing (Product + QA)
- **Target**: Feature sign-off
- **Frequency**: Before release
- **Tools**: Manual testing, user groups
- **Definition**: Verify feature meets requirements

#### Performance Testing
- **Target**: <500ms response (p95)
- **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Tools**: Apache JMeter, Locust
- **Definition**: Test under load

#### Security Testing
- **Target**: 0 critical vulnerabilities
- **Frequency**: Quarterly + before major release
- **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Bandit
- **Definition**: Test for security issues

### Test Coverage Goals

```
Phase 1: 70% coverage (critical paths)
Phase 2: 75% coverage (post-deploy stabilization)
Phase 3: 80% coverage (target)
Phase 4: 85% coverage (advanced features)
Phase 5: 85%+ coverage (maintenance)
```

### QA Metrics

| Metric | Target | Review |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Test Coverage | 80%+ | Weekly |
| Bug Escape Rate | <5% | Per release |
| Test Pass Rate | >95% | Daily |
| Critical Bugs | 0 in production | Weekly |
| Performance Regression | 0% | Monthly |

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Workflow

1. **Planning Phase** (1-2 days per feature)
   - Create feature specification
   - Break into tasks
   - Estimate effort
   - Identify risks

2. **Implementation Phase** (Design → Code → Test)
   - Create feature branch
   - Write tests first (TDD recommended)
   - Implement feature
   - Code review (minimum 2 reviewers)
   - Merge to develop

3. **Testing Phase**
   - Unit tests (developer)
   - Integration tests (QA)
   - System tests (QA)
   - UAT (Product + users)

4. **Deployment Phase**
   - Staging deployment
   - Smoke tests
   - Production deployment
   - Monitoring

### Code Review Standards

- ✅ Minimum 2 approvals required
- ✅ 80%+ test coverage
- ✅ No critical issues from linter
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Performance impact assessed

### Documentation Standards

- ✅ Code comments for complex logic
- ✅ API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- ✅ User guides for new features
- ✅ Technical design documentation
- ✅ Deployment procedures documented
