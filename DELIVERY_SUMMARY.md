## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is this plan realistic?**  
A: Yes. Effort estimates based on industry standards, timeline includes buffers, team sizing appropriate for each phase, budget aligns with market rates.

**Q: Can we start sooner?**  
A: Yes! Phase 1 can start this week. No dependencies. PHASE1_SPRINT_PLAN.md ready to execute immediately.

**Q: Can we do it faster?**  
A: Not recommended. Phase 1 is critical foundation. Rushing causes problems. Phase 2+ can't proceed without Phase 1.

**Q: What if we're under budget?**  
A: Great! Use savings for training, tools, or accelerate Phase 3-4. Or return to budget holder.

**Q: What if we're over budget?**  
A: Identified during Phase 1. Options: (1) Extend timeline, (2) Reduce scope, (3) Increase budget, (4) Re-prioritize features.

**Q: What if team member leaves?**  
A: Plan accounts for this. Documentation-first approach. Knowledge sharing each sprint. Onboarding guide available.

**Q: Can we change priorities?**  
A: Yes, but not Phase 1. That's the critical path. Phase 2+ can be adjusted based on business needs.
