## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Code Style

This project follows Python and Django best practices:

- **Code Formatting**: [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) with 100 character line length
- **Linting**: [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for code quality checks
- **Style Guide**: [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

### Running Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Format code with Black
black sims/ --line-length 100

# Run Flake8 linter
flake8 sims/ --count --statistics

# Run both
black sims/ --line-length 100 && flake8 sims/ --count --statistics
```

### Git Workflow

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Make your changes and commit: `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
3. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
4. Create a Pull Request

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run tests for a specific app
python manage.py test sims.users

# Run with pytest (if configured)
pytest
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in `tests.py` within each app
- Follow Django testing best practices
- Aim for good test coverage of critical functionality
- Test both success and error cases

## 🚀 Deployment

### Development Deployment

The application is ready for development/testing deployment using the built-in Django development server.

### Production Deployment

For production deployment, consider:

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set `DEBUG = False` in settings
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS`

2. **Database**
   - Use PostgreSQL or MySQL for production
   - Configure proper database backup

3. **Static Files**
   - Collect static files: `python manage.py collectstatic`
   - Serve via nginx or CDN

4. **Web Server**
   - Use Gunicorn or uWSGI
   - Configure nginx as reverse proxy
   - Set up SSL/TLS certificates

5. **Security**
   - Enable security middleware
   - Configure HTTPS
   - Set up proper logging
   - Implement backup strategy
