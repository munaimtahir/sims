## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Code Style

This project follows Python and Django best practices:

- **Code Formatting**: [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) with 100 character line length
- **Linting**: [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for code quality checks
- **Style Guide**: [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

### Running Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Format code with Black
black sims/ --line-length 100

# Run Flake8 linter
flake8 sims/ --count --statistics

# Run both
black sims/ --line-length 100 && flake8 sims/ --count --statistics
```

### Git Workflow

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Make your changes and commit: `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
3. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
4. Create a Pull Request

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run tests for a specific app
python manage.py test sims.users

# Run with pytest (if configured)
pytest
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in `tests.py` within each app
- Follow Django testing best practices
- Aim for good test coverage of critical functionality
- Test both success and error cases

## 🔄 Celery Worker & Beat Setup

SIMS uses Celery for background task processing and scheduled tasks.

### Prerequisites

- Redis server running (required for Celery broker)
- Django migrations run (including `django_celery_beat` migrations)

### Running Celery Worker

```bash
# Start Celery worker
celery -A sims_project worker -l info

# With concurrency control
celery -A sims_project worker -l info --concurrency=2
```

### Running Celery Beat (Scheduler)

```bash
# Start Celery beat with DatabaseScheduler
celery -A sims_project beat -l info --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler
```

### Running Both (Development)

For development, you can run both in separate terminals, or use a process manager like `supervisord`.

### Database Migrations for Celery Beat

```bash
# Run migrations to create django_celery_beat tables
python manage.py migrate django_celery_beat
```

### Configuration

Celery configuration is in `sims_project/celery.py` and uses settings from `sims_project/settings.py`:

- `CELERY_BROKER_URL`: Redis broker URL (default: `redis://localhost:6379/1`)
- `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND`: Result backend URL (default: `redis://localhost:6379/1`)

Periodic tasks are configured in `sims_project/celery.py` and can be managed via Django admin after running migrations.

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

SIMS includes a complete Docker Compose setup for production-ready deployment.

### Prerequisites

- Other production settings as needed

Create a `.env` file in the project root with these values. See `.env.example` for reference.

### Health Checks

All services include health checks. Check service status:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

### Volumes

- `postgres_data`: PostgreSQL data persistence
